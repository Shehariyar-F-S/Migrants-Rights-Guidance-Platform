# Migrants-Rights-Guidance-Platform

A local Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that answers questions about migrants’ rights and procedures using official legal PDFs (for example, the Dublin Regulation) as its only knowledge source.
The system runs entirely on a laptop using open‑source tools (Ollama + Llama 3, ChromaDB, LangChain, Streamlit).

🚀 Features
Domain‑specific legal assistant for EU asylum and migration documents (starting with the Dublin Regulation)

Local‑only stack: all documents, embeddings, and LLM inference run on your machine

Multi‑PDF support: drop multiple PDFs into a folder and index them together

RAG pipeline:

PDF → text extraction → chunking

Sentence‑Transformer embeddings → Chroma vector store

Top‑k retrieval → Llama 3 via Ollama for grounded answers

Two interfaces:

CLI Q&A (terminal)

Web chat UI built with Streamlit

🧱 Architecture
1. Indexing (offline)
Load all PDFs from a data/ folder (for example, DUBLIN REGULATIONS.pdf and other guides)

Split pages into overlapping text chunks

Create dense embeddings with a Sentence‑Transformer model (for example, all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Store embeddings, chunk texts, and metadata (including source filename) in a persistent ChromaDB collection (for example, dublin_chroma)

2. Retrieval & generation (online)
For each user question:

Embed the question with the same Sentence‑Transformer model

Retrieve top‑k similar chunks from Chroma

Build a legal‑style prompt: “answer only from this context; if not present, say you don’t know”

Call Llama 3 running locally via Ollama to generate a concise answer

Optionally display which PDF each answer is grounded in

3. User interfaces
CLI: ask questions in the terminal and receive answers as plain text

Web UI (Streamlit): chat‑style interface with history, suitable for demoing in a browser

├── app.py                # Streamlit web UI
├── index_pdfs.py         # One‑time (or occasional) indexing script
├── query_cli.py          # CLI question‑answer interface
├── dublin_rag.py         # Core RAG logic (rag_answer function)

🔧 Setup
1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/migrants-rights-guidance-platform.git
cd migrants-rights-guidance-platform
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
A typical requirements.txt:

text
langchain
langchain-community
chromadb
sentence-transformers
pypdf
streamlit
ollama
4. Install and configure Ollama
Install Ollama from its official site

Pull the Llama 3 model:

bash
ollama pull llama3
Test that it runs:

bash
ollama run llama3
5. Add PDFs
Place your legal PDFs inside the data/ directory, for example:

text
data/
 ├── DUBLIN REGULATIONS.pdf
 ├── guide_1.pdf
 └── guide_2.pdf
🧮 Step 1 – Index the documents
Run the indexing script (once or whenever the PDFs change):

bash
python index_pdfs.py
This script:

Iterates over all *.pdf files in data/

Extracts text and splits it into chunks

Embeds each chunk with all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Stores embeddings + text + metadata in a ChromaDB collection under db/

💬 Step 2 – Ask questions (CLI)
Use the terminal interface:

bash
python query_cli.py
Example interaction:

text
Your question (or 'exit'): Who is responsible for examining an asylum application under the Dublin Regulation?

Answer:
<model answer here>

Your question (or 'exit'):
🌐 Step 3 – Web UI (Streamlit)
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
streamlit run app.py
Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

With the web app you can:

Ask questions about the Dublin Regulation and related documents

See answers generated by Llama 3, grounded in the indexed PDFs

Optionally see which source document each answer used

🔍 Example questions
You can try questions like:

“Which country is responsible for examining my asylum application under the Dublin rules?”

“What happens if my fingerprints were taken in another EU country?”

“How are family members treated in the Dublin procedure?”

“Are there special rules for unaccompanied minors?”

🧱 Tech stack
Language model: Llama 3 (via Ollama, running locally)

Orchestration: LangChain

Vector database: ChromaDB (persistent, local)

Embeddings: Sentence‑Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

PDF processing: PyPDF / LangChain PyPDFLoader

UI: Streamlit (web), Python CLI (terminal)

🌱 Future work
Add multilingual support (for example, English and German answers)

Expose article‑level citations and links back into the PDFs

Extend beyond the Dublin Regulation to broader EU and national migration law

Add authentication and role‑based access for NGOs or caseworkers
